# Guess the State - Learning Project

Welcome to Guess the State! This is a Python project aimed at learning CSV file handling, data manipulation using the Pandas library, and basic game development with the Turtle module. In this project, users get to guess the names of the 50 states of the USA by providing input.

## Topic of Learning

This project focuses on learning the following topics:

- CSV file handling
- Data manipulation with Pandas
- Basic game development using the Turtle module

## How to Play

1. Run the program.
2. You will be prompted to enter the name of a state.
3. If the state entered is one of the 50 states of the USA, its name will be displayed on a map.
4. If the state entered is incorrect or misspelled, you will be prompted to guess again.
5. To exit the game, simply type 'exit' when prompted for input.
6. Upon exiting the game, a new CSV file will be generated containing the names of the states that you didn't guess correctly.
